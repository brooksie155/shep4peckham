                <b>I'm Claire Sheppard, a proud Peckham local for the past 17 years.</b>
                <p>
                        I live with my husband, our little boy and our chocolate Lab. My husband and I both run small businesses 
                        in SE15 so the future of this area is close to our hearts.
                        I'm not a member of a political party; I'm standing as an Independent candidate here in Peckham Rye 
                        Ward in the Southwark council elections on May 3rd 2018.

                margin-top: 25px;
                margin-bottom: 10px;'>
            <ul class='' style=''>
                <li> I am a passionate advocate for our community. I help Admin the Nunhead Rocks forum on Facebook and love helping others if I can on there. I love that it’s a friendly place on the internet and it’s something I see here in the real world too.</li>
                <li> Being a dog walker and environmentalist I really care about our green spaces, parks and trees. I also care that dog owners are responsible and hope that we all work together, to share our open spaces, in a way that benefits canines and us, their human butlers.</li>
                <li> I believe the issues around Housing, Planning, Regeneration are incredibly important at a time when decent housing is massively over subscribed whilst luxury apartments are built to sit empty.</li>
                <li> I believe that the views of residents in Southwark have, in recent years, often appeared secondary to those of private investors. I think that our current councils failure to build and maintain council housing is disappointing at best.</li>
                <li> I believe that the charges for Major Works levelled at Leaseholders are disproportionate and causing big problems to Leaseholders across the Borough. I’d like to improve consultation around this issue so that everyone gets a say, not just those that can afford to take the Council to First Tier Tribunal.</li>
                <li> I believe that a Council should be working for the good of those that live in the Borough. I believe the views of existing communities shouldn’t be swept away in the name of regeneration.</li>
                <li> I think the people who actually live here should have a louder voice in discussions about what is built and for whom and what it looks like.</li>
                <li> I want all kids in our Ward to have access to great, well funded and resourced schools. I want young people to feel safe and supported in our neighbourhood. I want there to be things for young people to do, and am interested in how we can use our community spaces to do more for the younger members of our community.</li>
                <li> With cuts to budgets, I am keen to ensure funds needed to support elderly and vulnerable members of our community are ringfenced. I believe we could have more community led initiatives and events to reach out to those feeling lonely or marginalised.</li>
                <li> I’m keen to see the condition of our roads to be improved </li>
                <li> I’d like the impact of on the environment to be at the heart of planning decisions across Council departments and policy.</li>
                <li> The only thing I’m a shareholder in is the Ivy House, Graham and Geoff are available for character references.</li>
                <li> I’m not concerned with our area becoming more of a destination I want the Ward to work well for our existing community. I’d like to explore on how we can support and encourage our local independent businesses to flourish and how to encourage them to give back to our community.</li>
                <li> In recent times I have found the Council’s approach to consultation with the community to be flawed, especially where this has informed policy decision. Whether over dog walking restrictions, or the mooted market on Nunhead Green, or the use of Peckham Rye Park for private events. </li>
                <li> When an issue will have very real implications on the community I believe it’s important that the views of those affected are taken to the heart of policy decisions. I believe our Councillors should be putting themselves out there to see what their neighbours think about the issues that affect our Ward</li>
                <li> As a councillor I’d work towards more community support and cohesion with my focus firmly on the Ward. I believe that a Council needs to represent a good mix of viewpoints and this simply isn’t the case with such a overwhelmingly Labour council.</li>
                <li> Every day my neighbours seem to tell me about decisions are made buy our Council which perplex and frustrate many residents. </li>
                <li> We are supposed to be represented on our Council but I know that many of us feel voiceless as we aren’t within the party system. That’s why I am standing to give those of us who don’t care about a Party but really care about our community, a voice.</li>

            <ul>
                <li> I’m 41, I grew up in council housing, in a big Irish family in King’s Lynn, Norfolk.</li>
                <li> My mum was a hospital cleaner and then a home help, my dad was a civil engineer specialising in concrete, I’m the youngest of 4 girls.</li>
                <li> I was in the first generation of my family to go to university and I did English Literature and Politics in Sunderland. My conclusion upon completing the Politics course was I’d never trust a politician, so this *gestures at everything* is something I never expected to do, but something I do have some academic knowledge about and a lifelong interest in.</li>
                <li> I’ve lived in Peckham Rye Ward for about 17years, on Forest Hill Rd for a little bit, Ivydale Rd for a long time and Hawkslade Rd for about 10 years. </li>
                <li> We are leaseholders in a council block, before that I rented in the area.</li>
                <li> I’m not just in SE15 at evenings and weekends; I run my own market research business out of the Office Club in the Bussey Building and my husband runs his own sports massage business out of Holdrons Arcade in Peckham. </li>
                <li> We have a 2 ½ year old son, who goes to a local nursery and a chocolate Labrador called Hurley. </li>
                <li> In my spare time I like to read, write, cook, sing, dance and laugh.</li>
                <li> I’ve helped run Nunhead Community choir, I co -admin the Nunhead Rocks FB community, I set up and am President of Nunhead WI, I have run various community and fundraising events including the local Grenfell collection.</li>
                <li> Last year with the support of our community we raised over £6k for Guy’s and St Thomas’ Cancer Wing mostly thanks to my husband who actually ran the marathon, we wanted to say thank you to them for curing my cancer after the birth of our son. I blogged about whole adventure here https://shinyshep.wordpress.com/ (warning contains swearing, earworms and incredibly honest opinions)</li>
                <li> I love Peckham and Nunhead and I want to be a strong independent voice in our Council representing Peckham Rye Ward. I’m not going to start wearing suits any time soon  but superhero costumes I can’t rule out</li>
                <li> I’m aiming to be a kind, honest politician who has experience of what life is like for many of the people I hope to represent. Think Lesley Knope but less well-groomed and slightly swearier.</li>
                <li> I hope you’ll consider using one of your votes for me on May 3rd. Use your other vote to vote for whatever party best represents you but why not try something new with putting the focus on local in Local Government.</li>
